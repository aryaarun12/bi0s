You either know, XOR you don't 		
I've encrypted the flag with my secret key, you'll never be able to guess it.
Remember the flag format and how it might help you in this challenge!

-Since a hint is given as "flag format" which is "crypto{"
-First 8 bits of ciphertext were xored with "crypto{"
-And we got one part of flag "Myxorke" and we can assume there must be a "Y" (i saw similiar challenges")
-then the key is repeated to match the length of ciphertext and 
-both input and key is then xored
