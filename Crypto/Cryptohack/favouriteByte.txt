Favourite byte
I've hidden my data using XOR with a single byte. Don't forget to decode from hex first.

-s stores the unhexilified string
-An array is created with the characters from the string
-Since there are 256 ascii characters, we create a loop
-And with each iteration we store the xored value of the initial string with the ascii value, which is merged into a string
-And if the string has "crypto" in it, it is printed
-->crypto{0x10_15_my_f4v0ur173_by7e}
