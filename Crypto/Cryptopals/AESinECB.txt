AES- use keys of 128, 192 and 256 bits
import AES module from pycrypto lib-  from Crypto.Cipher import AES
The length of the key needs to be 16, 24 or 32 bytes long, depending if we want to use AES-128, AES-192 or AES-256 respectively 
Here its "YELLOW SUBMARINE" =16 
new function of the AES module.--> use the key and mode parameters.(mode parameter corresponds to the chaining mode that is used for decryption / encryption)
syntax: cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB) ---> known as AESCipher object
final plaintext--> cipher.encrpyt/decrypt(msg)
