### It's Complicated My Pal
Hey pal, I was sniffing some packets and stumbled upon some weird traffic, no idea what it is though.
Could you take a look at it? It's complicated for me and I can't analyze it by myself.
File Name: capture.tar.gz

On analysing the file with wireshark 
Found some icmp packets which had some zip file being shared
Extracted it using scapy:
The script-->


from scapy.all import *
packet= rdpcap ( 'capture.pcap' )
data= '' 
for p in packet:
     if p.haslayer (ICMP):
         if p [IP].src == '192.168.1.200' :
            data=data+(p [Raw] .load)
#data=str.encode(data)
with  open ( 'flag.zip' , 'wb' ) as f:
    f.write (data)


$ python a.py
The extracted zip file was password protected

$ fcrackzip -v -u -D -p rockyou.txt flag.zip
found file 'flag.jpg', (size cp/uc 225389/225940, flags 9, chk ac92)
checking pw buday1                                  
PASSWORD FOUND!!!!: pw == craccer

The zip had a jpeg whoch gave the flag-->
