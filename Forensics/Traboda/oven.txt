CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION
I have intercepted one of my friend's chat. Can you help me in analyzing it?
Flag format: inctf{some_l33t_string}

-After a lot of analysing on the given pcap file, 
-Applied filter 'data', and found the conversation:
-Some of it was encrypted, but decoded it using caeser cipher, ROT 5 (they gave hint by highlight 'fifth' in  the conversation
-The conversation said:
	This is a sample in that encoded way.
	Oh, It's good and it took a lot of time to understand for me.
	Sending you some interesting files, try to find the secret behind them and keep it confidential
	Transferring files....
-Afte that there are lot of packets with huge amt of data .. some 800bytes to 2 different ports and some 1330 bytes
-Wrote a scapy script and extracted 3 of them seperately as- 444, 81, 1330
-But none of them made sense
-After trying out a few things, I tried rotating the hexdump of those 3 extracted files, of which file 444 gave--> %PDF and file 81 gave--> PK 
-So 444 and 81 can be a pdf and zip file respectievely
-Extracting it using the scapy script, we got--> 81.zip and 444.pdf

-81.zip was password protected so:
	 $ fcrackzip -v -u -D -p ../rockyou.txt 81.zip
	gave-->PASSWORD FOUND!!!!: pw == johnjandroveclarkmichaelkent
-Unzip the file, we get a image "flag.png"
-After a lot of analysing on the image i gave:
	$ zsteg -a flag.png
	gave a 'Lorem ipsum text, tried googling and decoding, realised it was just a random text so,
	
	$ zsteg -E b1,bgr,lsb,xy flag.png > flag.txt
	$ strings flag.txt | grep inctf
gave the flag-->
